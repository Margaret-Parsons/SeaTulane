# SeaTulane
This is a Figma model of a library capacity tracker I made for my Human-Computer Interaction class. I worked with Zoe Birnbaum (Zbirnbaum@tulane.edu), Chaelin Kim (Ckim13@tulane.edu), and Syeda Mah Noor Asad (Sasad1@tulane.edu). Our proposed problem was that it was too hard to find a seat in the library during finals, so a web app that shows you which seats in the library are full would be useful! We called it SeaTulane as it's a portmanteau of "seat" and "Tulane" (plus, since Tulane's mascot is the Green Wave, it makes sense for the name to have "sea" involved as well). 

Please look at the flow by going to https://www.figma.com/proto/6y7feH1DRMB1kxJSAnJPM4/SeaTulane?node-id=1-206&p=f&t=9JV9waTQBG73PDBW-1&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A206&show-proto-sidebar=1 ! I have also included a pdf with all the different frames
